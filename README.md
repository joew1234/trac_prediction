# Sale Price Prediction - Heavy Equipment Industry

Used Linear regression model to predict the selling price of a tractor based on parameters which include, age, location and few other parameters. Regularized the model using Lasso method to reduce impact of noise. Primary work was focused on extracting insightful features, which increased accuracy to 70%.

Due to confidentiality, the data is not made public. The python code is made available in the src file.
